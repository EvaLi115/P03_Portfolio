          p To start this off, ideas were put down on sticky notes and used it to form affinity diagrams. I have suggested building an app for couples only. After brainstorming and combining other ideas, we decided to design a social networking app for loyal couples only. The main goal of the app is to help long-distance couples to manage, maintain and improve their relationship for situations like loneliness, arguments and bonding. And at the same time, making a timeline that records their life events.

        p Once the idea is set, I helped to complete the questionnaire for interviewing the couples and conducted two interviews, asking 2 participants (currently in a long-distance relationship) to answer the designed questionnaire to find out goals and frustrations in their relationship.

        p From the analysis of interviews, we generated a detailed set of sketches for each feature/page in the app together. I then used Adobe Illustrator to mockup all the features and some relevant pages in the app. At the same time, I also planned a little bit for some possible interactions steps and made the frames.

        p Immediately after making mockups and interaction frames in Adobe Illustrator, I exported everything into InVision. Using InVision, I linked up all the frames to prototype the interaction flow between all the features within the app.

        p One of the big features in the app is about using emojis to alert the partner about current mood and then setting up some options of action for the partner to do. This helps to give the partner some suggestions for actions for a specific mood.

        p As emoji is a big feature, I designed a set of emojis specifically for the app. The set of emojis is designed somewhat cute, this is meant to cheer up the end user’s mood when they see the adorable emojis.

        p In order to get a better user experience for interaction and usability, I switched all previous prototype pages from InVision to Proto.io. The reason is that InVision uses static wireframes to prototype, but Proto.io helps to create a fully interactive prototype that feels more real.

        p After I update the prototype in Proto.io, the couples that were interviewed at the beginning of the project were asked to try out the prototype and asked for feedback. This is user test, checking if the designed features can actually help them to achieve their goals. With the feedback, I modified some interaction preferences in the prototype.

          h3 · &nbsp;&nbsp;My Reflection&nbsp;&nbsp; ·

        p At the beginning of the project, I have suggested building an app for couples only, I have tried out a few relationship apps, and it does not fully fulfil my requirements of managing information for my relationship. So I wish to build a customized app to be used by different couples, allowing the couples to build up and manage a private space belonging to the two only.

        p For this project, I discovered it is very constrained to design for the end users when three-quarters of the team also fit in the end user criteria. This is very problematic, while the goal for the end users and the designers may differ. So I concluded that it is very important to set the right mind while designing for end users. As designers, we should focus on the end user’s goal, and do not assume for the users.
