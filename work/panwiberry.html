          <div>
            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p>The members of Panwiberry dance crew lacks communication and practice motivations, which drops their team spirits for performance. </p>

            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>A mobile App to aid the members' form of communication, boost members' morality and motivation in order to improve their relationship and team spirits for a better dance performance.  </p>

            <h3>My Roles:</h3>
            <p>User research, User Interviews, User Analysis, Persona Creation, Cultural Probe Creation, User Journey Flow, Wireframing, and Prototyping. </p>

            <h3>Tools Used:</h3>
            <p>MS Word (Research Documentation & Analysis), Adobe Illustrator CC (Research posters include Analysis, Cultural Probe, User Flow), and Proto.io (Wireframes & Prototype). </p>

          <h3 class="center_align">· &nbsp;&nbsp;Participant Ethnography Data Collection&nbsp;&nbsp; ·</h3>
          <p>I studied the members within the group's first weekly practice meeting for 5 hours. The data collected includes the group's culture, members' values towards the group, their behaviours around each other, and the kind of language and tone used in the activity. In order to find the data, I closely observed the members in person by taking photography and video recording, and then interviewed them about their status in the club and their thoughts during their practice activity. These data are then used to develop a design focus and a thematic analysis for the group.</p>

          <p>From the data collected and the analysis about the participant group's behaviours and activities, three personas are been formed in three levels to represent the participants as the end users.</p>

          <p>2.	Aurora Pierre: female, experienced dancer. Frustrations: new environment, language barrier</p>

          <p>Having the end users in mind, I designed a set of customized booklet specifically for each participant to complete individually within a week. These customized booklets contain questions asking about their personal values toward the group, their personality, daily behaviour patterns, and motivation. The goal is to better engage and develop a better relationship between our research group and the participants. The result is then used to refine design focus.</p>

          <p>Although there was a lot of data to be collected and analyzed, I found this project very interesting and engaging. This is one of the first experience allowed me to work closely with the end users, where they also acted as the stakeholders. I liked the experience of helping the end users to solve a problem, and getting feedback from them to improve the usability in the way they preferred. </p>

          <p>Through this project, I have learnt new ways to study and analysis audiences to gain better user experience and efficient user interfaces for the targeted end users. In the future, I hope I can some opportunities to work on developing apps, not just staying at the stage of prototyping app. </p>
